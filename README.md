Doctor-Patient Appointment Booking Backend with Ktor and Atlas MongoDB
Introduction
This project serves as the backend for the Doctor-Patient Appointment Booking Android Application. It is built using Ktor, a powerful asynchronous web framework for Kotlin, and Atlas MongoDB, a cloud-based database service. The backend provides APIs to handle user authentication, appointment management, and communication between doctors and patients.

Features
User Authentication

Users can register and create accounts.
Existing users can log in securely with their credentials.
Token-based authentication is used to validate user sessions.
Doctor Profile Management

Doctors can create and manage their profiles.
Profile information includes name, specialty, contact details, and availability.
Doctors can update their availability status for appointment booking.
Patient Profile Management

Patients can create and maintain their profiles.
Profile information includes name, contact details, and medical history.
Appointment Request and Scheduling

Patients can request appointments with specific doctors.
Doctors receive appointment requests and can accept or decline them based on availability.
Once accepted, appointments are scheduled and saved in the database.
Both doctors and patients can view their scheduled appointments.
Real-time Communication

The backend handles real-time communication between doctors and patients.
It enables notifications for appointment status updates, ensuring a seamless experience.
Security

Passwords are stored securely using encryption techniques.
Token-based authentication prevents unauthorized access.
Prerequisites
Kotlin SDK
MongoDB Atlas account (or any MongoDB instance)
Gradle
Getting Started
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/doctor-patient-backend.git
Configure MongoDB

Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account or set up your MongoDB instance.
Obtain the connection URI for your MongoDB instance.
Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project's root directory.
Add the following environment variables to the .env file:
makefile
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Build and Run the Application

arduino
Copy code
gradle run
API Endpoints

Refer to the API documentation for details on available endpoints and request/response formats.
Project Structure
The project follows a standard Ktor application structure:

src/main/kotlin/
Application.kt: Entry point for the Ktor application.
routes/: Contains route handlers for different endpoints.
models/: Defines data models for users, appointments, and other entities.
services/: Contains services responsible for business logic.
config/: Configuration files for database, authentication, and other settings.
Deployment
You can deploy the backend application to a cloud hosting service like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Ensure that the environment variables (such as the MongoDB connection URI and JWT secret key) are set up correctly in the hosting environment.

Future Enhancements
Socket-Based Communication: Implement WebSocket-based communication for real-time updates instead of traditional REST endpoints.
Role-Based Access Control: Introduce role-based access control to distinguish between doctors and patients, allowing different levels of access to certain endpoints.
Caching and Rate Limiting: Introduce caching mechanisms and rate limiting to optimize API performance and prevent abuse.
Conclusion
The Doctor-Patient Appointment Booking Backend built with Ktor and Atlas MongoDB serves as the backbone for the Android application. By providing robust authentication, appointment management, and real-time communication, it enables smooth interactions between doctors and patients. Feel free to contribute to the project and make it even better! If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, please create an issue in the repository.
